#DESCRIPTION: 
CODTECH C LANGUAGE INTERNSHIP TASKS – PROJECT DESCRIPTION This repository contains the completed solution for all four internship tasks assigned by CODTECH as part of the C Programming Language internship. The internship primarily focused on practical implementation of core C programming concepts, including file handling, data structures, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques. Each task was carefully designed to enhance hands-on coding skills and provide real-world problem-solving experience in the C programming language

Task 3: Lexical Analyzer – Identifying Tokens This task introduces a simplified version of a lexical analyzer, which is a core component of compilers. The objective is to read from an input C file (input.c) and identify:

1.Keywords like int, float, if, else, etc. 2.Operators such as +, -, *, /, etc. 3.Identifiers (variable/function names).

In task3.c, the program scans the input character by character, forms words, and then classifies them using simple checks. Though it's a basic version, it demonstrates how real compilers tokenize source code before further parsing. This task gives a practical insight into compiler design basics, which is essential for those aiming to work in systems programming or compiler development.
